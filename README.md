# nlp

A Clojure implementation of the algorithms found in Speech and Language
Processing by Daniel Jurafsky and James H Martin.

The purpose of this code base is twofold; To improve my comfortability and
skills with Clojure, and to improve my knowledge of algorithms used in
Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.

## Implementations

### Chapter 2

* Exercise 2.2 implemented ELIZA in src/nlp/eljza.clj

### Chapter 4

* Exercise 4.2 implemented in src/nlp/ngrams.clj
* Exercise 4.4 implemented in src/nlp/ngrams.clj

### Chapter 6

* Exercise 6.1 implemented in src/nlp/hmm.clj as function forward
* Exercise 6.2 implemented in src/nlp/hmm.clj as function viterbi

## Usage

I will add some example usage in the near future.


## Todo

* Implement Exercise 3.11 (Minimum Edit Distance)
* Implement Exercise 4.5 (Good-Turing Discounting)
* Implement Exercise 4.6 (Katz Backoff)
* Implement Exercise 4.7 (Compute Perplexity)

* Implement Test Cases (Learn how first!)
* Implement Proper Documentation (Learn how first!)
